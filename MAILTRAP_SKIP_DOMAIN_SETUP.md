# Mailtrap Setup - Skip Domain Configuration

## You Don't Need Domain Setup for Testing! ✅

The page you're seeing is for **Email Sending** (production emails), but we only need **Email Testing** (which doesn't require a domain).

## Quick Solution:

### Option 1: Skip This Step (Recommended)
1. Click **"Back"** button (bottom right)
2. Or look for a **"Skip"** or **"Skip for now"** link
3. You'll be taken to your inbox where you can get SMTP credentials

### Option 2: Use a Test Domain
If you can't skip, just enter any test domain:
- `test.local`
- `example.com`
- `goldenpalms.test`
- `localhost`

**Note:** This won't affect email testing - it's just for the onboarding flow.

### Option 3: Navigate Directly to Inbox
1. Look for **"Inboxes"** or **"Email Testing"** in the top menu
2. Click on it to go directly to your inbox
3. You can get SMTP credentials from there

## What You Actually Need:

For email **testing** (what we're doing), you need:
- ✅ Your Mailtrap inbox
- ✅ SMTP credentials from the inbox settings
- ❌ **NOT** domain setup (that's for sending real emails)

## Next Steps After Getting Past This:

1. Go to your **Inbox** (should be in the left sidebar or top menu)
2. Click on **"SMTP Settings"** tab
3. Select **"PHP"** from the dropdown
4. Copy your **Username** and **Password**
5. Use those in the setup script

## If You're Stuck:

You can also:
- Close this onboarding and go directly to: https://mailtrap.io/inboxes
- Or use the test domain: `test.local` and click Finish

The domain setup is optional for testing purposes!
