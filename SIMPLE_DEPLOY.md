## Option 2: Render.com (Easier Alternative)

Render is often simpler than Railway. Here's why:

✅ **Easier setup** - Less configuration needed  
✅ **Better documentation** - Clearer error messages  
✅ **Free tier** - Similar to Railway  
✅ **Auto-deploy from GitHub** - Same as Railway  

### Quick Render Setup:

4. **Set environment variables** (simple form)
5. **Deploy** - That's it!

Would you like me to:
- **A)** Create Render deployment config files?
